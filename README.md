# Webpack-Workflow
This is just a repository in which I try to use things like ES6 with Webpack and Babel and possibly other tools that might be added.

## Changes
- Added Sass
- Added Pug
- General folder structure

## The develop branch
The develop branch is most likely the most up-to-date version of this repository at all times. I will only push to master when I am happy with the implementation of something.
